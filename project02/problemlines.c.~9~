   The purpose of this program is to output the
   line numbers in a file that have length greater
   than 80. This program takes in input from 
   the program lengthwarning.c, which tracks
   which lines in its input have length 
   greater than 80. If a particular line 
   has length greater than 80, its line 
   number is printed as output. This 
   program will be useful to test style 
   for future projects in conjunction 
   with lengthwarning.c.
